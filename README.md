## Reverse an Array ( [Link](./code-challenges/401/reverse-array/ArrayReverse.java) )
Take an array of integers and reverse it in place.

### Challenge
We are reversing an array. The examples were all integers, so we assumed that was the target. 

### Approach & Efficiency
We used a swap value to reverse the array, starting from the first and last, and moving in. It runs in O(n)
